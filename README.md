# Materials to learn hand-on about specific ML problems 

It starts with showcasing the improvement of convolutional models over linear

I am not sure this repository will grow into a full-fledged project. Plans and issues
will be listed on the [board](https://github.com/users/bryzgalovdm/projects/3).
